    "I am currently interested in understanding how matrimonial advertisements— advertisements that are published seeking matches with prospective brides and grooms— in newspapers have changed over the years, in northern India.  I plan on looking at archived digital ads from 1998 to 2014 with ‘the Tribune’ the largest selling English language paper in 6 major north Indian states. Some of these ads mention traits such as facial complexion, willingness to migrate, caste etc. and I want to see how the characteristics of the social game of seeking partners has changed, and how this might align with developments in and around the states."

    "The tradition of seeking matrimony through advertisements has been prevalent in India for several decades. Since these advertisements elicit alliances and aim to act as a filter for prospective partners, they tend to be very descriptive and can be a good way of understanding several social dynamics such as age at which men and women get married, social desirability of a caste, importance of education in matrimony etc, and looking at them can give a great understanding of the social fabric of these states and how it has changed in tandem with other developments. Even though there are several websites that now post these ads, I stick to newspapers since I want to study how things have changed over time, from a point when there were no websites. I believe the limitations for this could be lack of representativeness of the sample, sparse nature of the data, and nuanced language used. This study can be scaled up if it is combined with the e-advertisements and multiple newspapers, to have a more comprehensive understanding of the social landscape."
