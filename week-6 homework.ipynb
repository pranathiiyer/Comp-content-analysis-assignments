Thus, variables based on contects of these ads such as caste, physical attributes etc. can be used to develop a regression model which can capture how much the weight of each oif these in the ads is changing over the years along with support from other topic models or embedding models, and can then be used to predict future ads.

    "The authors try to estimate the effects of exercise on mental health by using tweets that express anxiety, depression, and anger. They use an approach of matching by utilizing information related to gender from US census data, geo location, and other information available to tackle confounding bias. Their observational study was successful in finding that there are lesser incidences of tweets expressing anxiety and depression amongst ussers engaged in physical activity, which was captured using their use of physical activity trackers."
